# Student Examples

These are self-contained teaching examples. Each one is a single Python file that demonstrates a different RL concept applied to F1TENTH racing. You can read any example top-to-bottom without needing to understand the rest of the framework.

## How to Use

Every example follows the same pattern:
```bash
python3 examples/<example>.py                    # Train
python3 examples/<example>.py --eval --render    # Watch the trained policy drive
```

## The Examples

### Example 1: Simple PPO (`1_simple_ppo.py`)
**What you'll learn:** The absolute basics of RL for robotics.

This is where to start. It creates a minimal F1TENTH environment, trains a PPO agent, and evaluates it. Everything is in one file — environment wrapper, training loop, evaluation. The car starts by crashing into walls, and over 500k steps it gradually learns to drive laps.

```bash
python3 examples/1_simple_ppo.py --steps 500000
python3 examples/1_simple_ppo.py --eval --render
```

### Example 2: Race Against an Opponent (`2_race_against_opponent.py`)
**What you'll learn:** Multi-agent environments, how RL handles dynamic obstacles.

Two cars on the track: your RL agent vs a pure pursuit bot. The RL agent sees the opponent through its lidar as a moving obstacle and has to learn to drive fast without crashing into it. This teaches the agent defensive driving and overtaking.

```bash
python3 examples/2_race_against_opponent.py --steps 1000000
python3 examples/2_race_against_opponent.py --eval --render
```

### Example 3: Imitation Learning (`3_imitation_learning.py`)
**What you'll learn:** Learning from demonstrations, behavioral cloning, BC→RL fine-tuning.

Instead of learning from scratch, the agent first watches an expert (pure pursuit) drive and learns to imitate it. Then RL fine-tuning takes over to improve beyond the expert. This is the fastest way to get a competent policy.

```bash
python3 examples/3_imitation_learning.py --episodes 100 --steps 500000
python3 examples/3_imitation_learning.py --eval --render
```

### Example 4: Race Fast (`4_race_fast.py`)
**What you'll learn:** Reward shaping for speed, domain randomization, parallel training.

This example trains the agent to go FAST, not just survive. It uses a reward function that balances speed against safety (steering smoothness, wall proximity). Domain randomization is enabled to make the policy robust. Multiple environments run in parallel for faster training.

```bash
python3 examples/4_race_fast.py --steps 1000000 --num-envs 4
python3 examples/4_race_fast.py --eval --render
```

### Example 5: PPO From Scratch (`5_ppo_from_scratch.py`)
**What you'll learn:** Exactly how PPO works, line by line. No libraries hiding the algorithm.

This implements the entire PPO algorithm in ~300 lines of PyTorch. No Stable-Baselines3 abstractions — just the raw math. You can trace the code from observation → action → reward → advantage → policy update. Run with `--render` to watch the car learn in real-time.

```bash
python3 examples/5_ppo_from_scratch.py --render --steps 500000
python3 examples/5_ppo_from_scratch.py --eval --render
```

## Recommended Order

If you're new to RL: 1 → 5 → 2 → 3 → 4

- Start with Example 1 to see the end-to-end pipeline.
- Read Example 5 to understand what's happening inside PPO.
- Then try 2, 3, 4 for advanced concepts.

### Example 6: Custom Reward Functions (`6_custom_reward.py`)
**What you'll learn:** How to write your own reward function and plug it in.

Shows three reward types: Trajectory-Aided Learning (reward matching an expert's speed/steering), Frenet-frame reward (reward based on lateral error and heading error relative to the raceline), and simple progress. If you're designing a reward for a specific racing objective (go fast, follow a line, match an expert), start here.

```bash
python3 examples/6_custom_reward.py --reward tal          # Trajectory-aided learning
python3 examples/6_custom_reward.py --reward frenet       # Frenet-frame reward
python3 examples/6_custom_reward.py --eval --render       # Watch
```

### Example 7: Custom Observations (`7_custom_observations.py`)
**What you'll learn:** How to add new information to what the agent sees.

Shows three observation extensions: opponent-aware (add distance/bearing to another car), dynamics-aware (add steering angle, slip angle, and lateral velocity from the vehicle state), and track-aware (add Frenet coordinates and curvature). If your project needs the agent to see something beyond lidar + velocity, this is the template.

```bash
python3 examples/7_custom_observations.py --obs opponent  # See opponents
python3 examples/7_custom_observations.py --obs dynamics  # See vehicle dynamic state
python3 examples/7_custom_observations.py --obs track     # See track geometry
python3 examples/7_custom_observations.py --eval --render  # Watch
```

### Example 8: Actuator Model + Curriculum Learning (`8_actuator_curriculum_learning.py`)
**What you'll learn:** Sim-to-real transfer with learned dynamics, progressive difficulty curriculum.

This is the full closed-loop learning pipeline. The agent learns with a neural network model of real actuator dynamics (predicting how the real car responds to steering commands) and progressively increases speed and reduces safety margins as training progresses. This bridges the reality gap between simulation and the physical robot.

Workflow:
1. Train RL policy in simulation
2. Deploy to robot, collect actuator data
3. Train dynamics model offline
4. Retrain RL policy with dynamics model (this example)
5. Deploy improved policy back to robot

```bash
# With trained actuator model and curriculum
python3 examples/8_actuator_curriculum_learning.py

# Or use command-line directly:
python3 scripts/train.py \
  --actuator-model path/to/actuator_net.pth \
  --actuator-scaler-X path/to/scaler_X.pkl \
  --actuator-scaler-y path/to/scaler_y.pkl \
  --curriculum \
  --curriculum-steps-per-phase 100000 \
  --total-steps 1200000
```

Key features:
- Optional actuator dynamics model (gracefully degrades if not available)
- Automatic curriculum progression (speed & safety margin schedules)
- Full closed-loop integration with robot data collection
- Logging of curriculum phase and difficulty metrics
